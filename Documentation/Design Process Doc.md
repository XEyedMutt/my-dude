Made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along with two underlying "doodads" kind of like a shelf.
The dooddads will eventually be attacted to the ramp otherwise it will fall off.
NO matter our solution for the slid-off issue, we know we need to create a doodad to move the lever up and down along with player input.
First step is to create one doodad that moves with player input
## What buttom would that be?
We know we're developing a mouse and keyboard, so no matter what platform the game is uploaded on, we have to have keyboard controls so that we can test the game as we develop it on PC
Commonly use WASD controls
